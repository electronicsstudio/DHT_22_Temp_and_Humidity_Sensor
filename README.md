# DHT_22_Temp_and_Humidity_Sensor

This code reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor using the DHT library and outputs the values to the Serial Monitor. 
The temperature is displayed in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, and the humidity is shown as a percentage. The readings are updated every 1 second.
